#!/bin/sh
#
# A generic /sbin/hotplug multiplexer program
#
# This script allows any program to be called when /sbin/hotplug is
# called.  It will run any programs located in the default hotplug
# directory (currently /etc/hotplug.d/) that match up with the first
# argument that this script is called with.  The matching is done by
# adding a directory name to the default directory and looking for any
# programs in that directory that are executable, and end in .hotplug
# (to allow backup programs to be live on safely.)
# 
# For example, if /sbin/hotplug is called with the usb argument then
# this script will look in the /etc/hotplug.d/usb/ directory for any
# executable programs that end in .hotplug.
#
# After all programs in the argument directory are executed, the
# "default" directory is searched for any executable programs in it,
# that end in .hotplug.  The default directory is currently
# /etc/hotplug.d/default/
